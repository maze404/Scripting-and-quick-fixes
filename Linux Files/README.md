<b>Random Coding Stuff</b>

Just a place for all my scripts and random stuff I create. Most of them just have random purposes, but I will list them here:

1. <b>[BASH] Commontoolscript:</b> Just a script I wrote which makes updating repositories and removing unused packages, as well as fixing a random xhost priviledge error when I was running any graphical interface as root. Just place it into your home directory and it should work out of the box. Includes a full menu and is probably common as hell.

2. <b>[BASH] NewUserScript:</b> A simple script for adding a new user in Ubuntu/Debian.

3. <b>[BASH] SSL-CSR-Creation:</b> A script that makes it easier to create a SSL CSR file and a RSA private key with either 2048 or 4096 bits. 

4. <b>[BASH] Gameserver Setup:</b> A script for quickly setting up a minecraft focussed gameserver with a webpanel on debian using pufferpanel and apache2. The script also configures the necessary firewall rules and has an option to prepare the server to work with offsite backups using rclone, onedrive and browsh (manual configuration is necessary for this!). A public IP and a DNS record are recommended.
